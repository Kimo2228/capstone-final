# Capstone Project

Link to public site: https://kimo2228.github.io/

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Description

The guided capstone project will involve building a fun application called Game of Thrones, using the API we have provided ice and fire
The capstone project website, [Title], is a fully functional web application designed to address [briefly describe the problem or need that the website aims to solve]. It serves as the culmination of our academic journey, showcasing the knowledge and skills we've acquired throughout our studies.

## List the features

User Registration and Authentication: Users can create accounts and log in securely to access personalized features.

[Specific Feature 1]: Describe a prominent feature of the website, such as search functionality, data analysis tools, communication features, etc.

[Specific Feature 2]: Highlight another key feature that sets the website apart.

[Specific Feature 3]: Mention additional features that add value to the website.

## Tests

Unit Tests:

Purpose: These tests focus on individual units or components of your application, such as functions, methods, or classes, to ensure they work correctly in isolation.
Scope: Test each function or method separately, covering a range of expected and edge cases.
Integration Tests:

Purpose: Integration tests check how different components of your app work together as a whole. It helps identify issues related to data flow and interactions between modules.
Scope: Test interactions between various units or modules, checking data transfers and dependencies.
Functional Tests:

Purpose: Functional tests examine the app's features from an end-user perspective, ensuring that the app functions as expected.
Scope: Test entire user flows or use cases, covering typical user interactions.
UI/UX Tests:

Purpose: UI and UX tests evaluate the user interface and user experience of the app. They ensure that the app is visually appealing and user-friendly.
Scope: Evaluate the app's layout, responsiveness, navigation, and visual elements.
Security Tests:

Purpose: Security tests help identify vulnerabilities in your app that could be exploited by malicious actors. This includes testing for common security issues like SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and authentication vulnerabilities.
Scope: Evaluate the app for security flaws and ensure data protection.
Performance Tests:

Purpose: Performance tests assess how the app performs under different conditions, including load testing to check its scalability and stress testing to identify performance bottlenecks.
Scope: Test the app's response time, resource usage, and scalability.
User Acceptance Tests (UAT):

Purpose: UAT involves actual users testing the app to ensure it meets their requirements and expectations.
Scope: Real users validate the app's functionality and provide feedback.
Regression Tests:

Purpose: Regression tests are performed after making changes to the app to ensure that new code doesn't introduce new bugs or break existing features.
Scope: Re-run existing tests to confirm that no previously working features are affected.
Accessibility Tests:

Purpose: Accessibility tests assess the app's compliance with accessibility standards (e.g., WCAG) to ensure it's usable by people with disabilities.
Scope: Evaluate the app for accessibility features such as screen reader compatibility and keyboard navigation.
Usability Tests:

Purpose: Usability tests involve observing real users interacting with the app to identify usability issues and gather feedback for improvements.
Scope: Analyze how users interact with the app, gather feedback, and mak

## User flow for the website

## Technology stack

Frontend: ReactJs
Live Server: GitHub Pages

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
